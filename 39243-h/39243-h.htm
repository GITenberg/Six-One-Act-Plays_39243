<p><i>From between the parted curtains two desert men in white costumes, with
red sashes and turbans appear. They wear scimiters in their sashes, and
are smoking very long cigarettes. They bow to one another, and walk to
the two sides of the stage, where they remain until first curtain, then
go behind. This is repeated before and after each part of the play.</i></p>

<p><i>Scene&mdash;A room in the home of Halima. Music and laughter are heard, and
as the curtain is drawn, a slave girl is seen finishing a wild dance. As
she sinks exhausted to the floor there are applause and sounds of
approval, in which the merchant Kodama leads. He is seated beside his
bride, Halima, on a dais. In the room are slaves, attendants and members
of the two families. The wedding celebration is in progress, and all are
in festal mood and dress. Rose petals are strewn on the floor, platters
heaped with fruits are at the front and side of the stage, and incense
is burning in two braziers.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Thy slave dances with the grace of a startled gazelle. Command
her again before night comes. I am pleased with her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I am glad she is fair in thine eyes, my husband. She knows many
magic dances that will delight thee.... But the wedding feast has
continued four days, my lord, and thy kinsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> from the desert not
appeared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Four days more shall the feasting last. There is yet time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I am eager for the jewels, and cloths of gold he was to bring.
Thou didst promise my father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Enough, enough! Art thou a child that patience is not in thee?
Before the feast has ended he will come. I weary of these murmurings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;(<i>Claps hands.</i>) Music for my lord.</p>

<p>(<i>Slave sings. As the song ends a slave appears before Kodama.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Slave to Kodama</span>&mdash;The young Sheykh Sindibad is here.</p>

<p>(<i>Sindibad appears L. with some men from his caravan, and a young slave,
who is carrying three bundles tied in silken cloths. He walks airily to
the dais.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Sindibad!</p>

<p>(<i>Sindibad and Kodama embrace. Halima, with a coquettish gesture, puts
her veil before her face.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Let forgiveness for my tardiness be granted, cousin, when thou
seest what I have brought. Many treasures have I found thy lady, before
whom I prostrate myself.</p>

<p>(<i>Sindibad kneels and kisses Halima's hand and then his own. His slave
boy quickly opens the bundles, and the contents are eagerly examined.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;I had thought to see thee sooner; the wedding is four days old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;I had thought to come sooner, but there was a maiden.... Never
have I seen such stars as were her eyes, and her lips, the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> of
pomegranate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Thou wast ever led easily by starry eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;(<i>Holding out scarf.</i>) See, it is a wondrous cloth, with threads
of gold and silver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Thy loveliness will enhance its beauties a thousand times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;My loveliness did not tempt thee to hasten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;I have never seen thy face, and there was a maiden....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;There was a maiden. Have done with thy raving! (<i>To Halima.</i>)
Let thy slave dance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Dance!</p>

<p>(<i>As the slave dances, all watch eagerly save Sindibad, who gazes at
Halima.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Thy voice is soothing as the sound of water in the heart of
the desert. Let me see thy face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Look at these fabrics rather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Nay, but an instant, while they watch the dancer, unveil, and
let me see thy face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I may not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;It is not forbidden. I am thy husband's kinsman. Let me see
thy face!</p>

<p>(<i>Halima drops veil. Sindibad prostrates himself.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;I am thy slave forever, oh fairer than the day at dawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Arise! they will see thee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;And thou hast married the merchant Kodama! Awah! Awah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Arise! Arise!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Why cryest thou awah? This is not a time for wailing. Dost
lament for the maiden of the desert?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Her image has changed ... as sand upon the desert's face.</p>

<p><i>Scene&mdash;The same. Kodama and Halima are seated on the dais as before.

before Kodama.</i></p>

have audience here?</p>

wife and the women. (<i>Exit C.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Sindibad enters L. as a slave comes from R. The slave is carrying
coffee, and reaches Halima as Sindibad approaches.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;I drink to thine amber eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Thou must not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I dare not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Send thy women away! I have words they must not hear.</p>

<p>(<i>Slave goes slowly C. from the room. Halima has risen from the dais,
and seated herself on a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> <i>rug in the centre of the room. She is humming
coquettishly and is admiring herself in a mirror. Sindibad watches her
eagerly for an instant.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;My blood has changed to leaping flame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;If thou comest nearer I shall call my women back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Unbind thy wondrous hair. It is a fountain of living gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Thou must not sit so close.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;I love thee, and shall stay until thou sayest, "I love thee."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;(<i>Stopping her song.</i>) I am thy kinsman's wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;By Allah! Thou art no man's wife but mine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I am but a dream. Awake, lest the Prophet smite thee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Oh, beautiful dream, I am mad for thee. To-night thou shalt
fly with me into the desert.</p>

<p>(<i>Kodama enters C. unnoticed, and listens.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I am thy kinsman's wife. My father gave me to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;The fire of youth has gone from his blood. He is old. Thou
canst not love him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Allah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;(<i>Slowly.</i>) I am his wife. (<i>Exit R.</i>)</p>

Kodama's entrance.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;With a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;The beautiful maiden who delayed thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> progress hither?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;I tell thee I have forgotten her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Thy heart is fickle surely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;I have seen one more beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;The dancing slave?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Yea ... even the dancing slave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Thou shalt have her. She is like the little moon when it first
peeps above the date palms. Thou shalt have her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Thy wife is young.... I will not have the dancing slave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;How now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Thy wife is young. Her skin is of pearl, her eyes twin amber
pools where men may&mdash;oh fool, oh blind, thy wife is young and beautiful.
Canst thou not see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;It is written: The blind man avoids the ditch into which the
clear-sighted falls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Thy heart is a dried grape. Thy wife is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;My wife! Art thou an honest Arab that she should so dwell in thy
thoughts? Take the dancing slave, and begone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Thy words are crystal dewdrops quivering on a leaf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Thou art young&mdash;tempt me not too far.</p>

<p>(<i>Slave enters immediately C. with a tray on which is wine.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;By the beard of the Prophet, wine! The Koran forbids it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;It shall turn to milk in the throat of the true believer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;Thou hast said it.</p>

<p>(<i>Kodama and Sindibad drink, and look at one another searchingly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Thy black angel is ever at thy left side in the city. It will
persuade thee into mighty wrong. Young cousin, it is wise that thou
shouldst return to thy people. Go quickly, lest evil come. I will give
thee rich presents for thy father. As for thee, choose one of the slave
girls&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;I will take with me nothing&mdash;but a dream. (<i>Exit L.</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Scene&mdash;The same. A slave is singing. Kodama is seated on the dais,
while Halima comes in slowly and gazes anxiously at him. It is the next
day.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Thy brows are still lowered. In what have I offended thee, my
husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I know not, unless thou sayest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;And thy skin is of pearl, is it not so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Shall I send away the women, oh my lord?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;I am not loving thee. Let the women and the lights remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I had hoped&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Thou hadst hoped! Am I a fledgling to faint under thy beauty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Thou didst marry me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;It was a wise bargain with thy father, whose hands will help
carry my trade into the desert, and beyond.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I thought thy kinsman Sindibad would do that. He is a son of the
desert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;I like not my kinsman. He is a fool and a magpie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;He is young and handsome, full of fire and poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;Full of deceit and treachery, with honeyed words that mean
nothing. But yesterday he raved of a maiden whom he met in the desert.
To-day he is mad for thy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;For my&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;For thy dancing slave. To-morrow he will go to the desert with
another nightingale piping at his elbow. He knows not constancy, but
flies from one deluded maiden to another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Surely thou wrongest him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;I wrong him not. We shall not talk of him.... Thy shimmering
hair has hidden thine ear. Let me put it back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;Oh, Kodama, thou hast never praised my hair before. See, it is a
fountain of living gold!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;(<i>Quickly.</i>) Who told thee that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;My ... women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;What other pretty things do they say to swell thy vanity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kodama</span>&mdash;As thou art a woman, and beautiful, I love thee ... no more ...
no less. Thou art a woman. I have said it!</p>

instant puts out her hands pleadingly to Kodama's retreating back, and

<p><span class="smcap">Slave Boy</span>&mdash;The young Sheykh Sindibad leaves for his father's tent in the

<p><span class="smcap">Halima</span>&mdash;I am afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sindibad</span>&mdash;By the hand of the Prophet, it was written thou shouldst love
me, and I thee.</p>

of love.</p>

<p><i>Scene&mdash;The back-drop shows mountains in the distance. Along the entire
back of stage is a stone bench against a low wall which overlooks the
Valley of the Darro River. The tops of one or two trees show above it.
At right back is a little turret, with entrance toward the audience.
Entrance at front right, through Moorish gateway. Entrance at left front
from garden.</i></p>

<p><i>Don Rodriguez and Lagrimas are discovered sitting together on the
bench. The soft tinkle of guitars is heard. Don Rodriguez is looking
straight out towards the audience with his hands clasped. Lagrimas is
gazing over the wall.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I tell thee it would be the easiest thing in the world to
capture Hafiz the Moor. I could creep through the Darro, for the thirsty
sun swallows the little river with one gulp in summer, and it is dry as
the road to Cordova. No one would see me until I reached the Mosque,
where Hafiz will be at his infidel prayers. Hafiz the Moor! The greatest
enemy to our King in all Spain, and I, I have found a way to capture him
with a handful of men. I think my father will call me a soldier then,
and thou wilt smile on my love, Lagrimas. No maiden can resist a
victorious soldier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;Look at the swallows building in the little turret. It must be
nesting time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;Lagrimas!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;Don Rodriguez!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I have been telling thee my plans to take Hafiz the Moor, and
of my love for thee, and thou answerest with some nonsense about
swallows, and nesting time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;I am very wise at times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;Surely it's not unwise to hear of my love and bravery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;I have heard thee speak much of both, Don Rodriguez.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I am a fool to think I could ever win thee. Thou dost make
sport of my affection, one minute cold, one minute hot. I never know how
to take thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;Do not take me at all, Don Rodriguez.</p>

<p>(<i>They sit silently a moment, Rodriguez in despair. At last Lagrimas
peeps provokingly at him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;There is a caballero wooing his inamorata. Listen to the
guitar. Music is very soothing in the cool of the evening. How rich and
soft his voice is! I would find it hard to flout such a seductive lover.
Dost thou not hear him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;I can hear him plainly. What has stopped thine ears?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;The beating of my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;A soldier's heart should not beat so loudly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;Mine does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;Poor soldier!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I'll not have thy scorn.... When I'm killed by the Moriscoes,
thou mayest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> repent thy coldness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;Little soldier, thou wast to <i>conquer</i> the Moriscoes; and
capture Hafiz, the enemy of King Philip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I shall conquer nothing. Deeds of valor are possible only
because a lady smiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;I smile always when with thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;Have thy jest. Broken lives mean nothing to a coquette.</p>

ankles and twinkling feet. Hast thou no modesty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feliciana</span>&mdash;If my ankles were thick, and my feet clumsy, I'd be modest as
a nun, and keep them chastely for thine eyes alone. Why should I hide
them when they are beautiful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feliciana</span>&mdash;Foolishness is wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pedro</span>&mdash;Well, they are not so bewitching as I have said. I have praised
them in moments of weakness, but they are only so-so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feliciana</span>&mdash;Don Rodriguez, I appeal to thee! Thou givest many an admiring
glance when I dance the zambra in the orange grove. Thine eyes betray
thee, now say, are they but so-so? (<i>Raises skirt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I&mdash;well&mdash;that is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;Why dost thou not answer? Feliciana's feet are small, but not
invisible. Look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> them, and pronounce judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I grieve for thee, Pedro. They will often dance on thy heart,
I fear, but in all truth and honesty, they are not so-so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feliciana</span>&mdash;Brave Don Rodriguez! I shall dance for thee to pay for thy
gallant approval.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I offer my hand, where I have given my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>&mdash;Dost thou not owe me the courtesy of knowledge? Am I to stumble
on thy secret like any outsider?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I would have told thee to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>&mdash;To-day is too late. Thou hast not my permission to marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;I am old enough to know when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> and whom I shall marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>&mdash;And if the door of my home is closed to thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>&mdash;Fool! If she will marry thee? Dost think she will allow thee to
slip through her fingers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;My grandfather fought the bulls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>&mdash;Thy grandfather! The most gallant gentleman of the Spanish
court, who rode into the arena on his own steed, and defied the bull in
the name of his lady love. To-day her father prods a sorry hack to its
death, and fights ... for a handful of silver!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;She is poor, I grant, but no word of scandal has ever
tarnished her name. Why dost thou oppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>&mdash;Canst thou blot out thy life, and the traditions of thy race?
Wilt thou not sicken of this girl's people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;Ah, he hurt thee with his cruel speech.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagrimas</span>&mdash;Nay, he was right. I can give thee nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodriguez</span>&mdash;Thou canst give me what I most lack, faith in myself. I am a

land beyond the farthest seas, and gave Spain a greater glory than she

who tear down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>&mdash;I warn thee, Hafiz, tolerance will not stretch much further.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hafiz</span>&mdash;Tolerance! Spain does not know the word. Thou hast banished the
Jews, thou hast given the rack, the gibbet and the stake to the
Christian heretics, thou wilt kill and exile the Moors. But beware, we
are the growers of rice and sugar, of cotton and silk, how will Spain
live when these fail?</p>

brings discretion, thou mayest talk more soberly.</p>

interest. The Property Man, in a black costume, remains at the back of

<p><i>The Curtain is drawn slightly open, and the Gong-bearer appears, strikes
the gong three times very slowly and ten times rapidly, then walks to
the right side of the stage, and stands there throughout the play.
Chorus appears between the parted curtains, holds up his left hand while
the Gong-bearer strikes once, then addresses the audience in a very
suave manner.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus</span>&mdash;Most illustrious friends, I deliver the three bows to Heaven,
Earth, and Man, (<i>bows ceremoniously to right, left, and centre</i>) and
obtrude myself on your exalted vision that you may know the meaning of
our poor play. The story deals with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> the always new love of youth for
maid, the abrupt tempering of a father's wrath to forgiveness, and the
immutability of Fate.</p>

<p>Our hero, Chang-sut-yen, (<i>Chang-sut-yen appears between the curtains,
bows to right, left and centre, then disappears behind the curtains</i>)
will come before you as a servant, but in reality he is none other than
the son of Chang-won-yin, the Great, ruler of this province of Canton.
(<i>Gong-bearer strikes the gong.</i>) The God of Fate decreed that he should
be known as a turtle dove, and have his image forever emblazoned on the
shining surface of a Willow plate. To avert this calamitous ending to
his august life, Chang-sut-yen has fled the home of his father, and
entered the service of a rich and powerful Mandarin, where he hopes, by
virtue of his obscure position, to escape the notice of the God. But, as
we have said, Fate is immutable, what the God plans must ever be,
despite the efforts of puny man.</p>

<p>You will see the Mandarin, (<i>Mandarin appears, bows, and disappears</i>)
rich, proud, majestic, with eyes for everything that may tend to make
him more powerful, but superbly blind to virtue and worth in the humble.</p>

<p>Kwen-lin, his daughter (<i>Kwen-lin appears, bows, and retires</i>) is swayed
by love alone; a dangerous practice usually, but in this story, one
begging your approval. Do not judge her harshly, in that her heart leads
her. Remember she is a woman. Much may be forgiven women.</p>

<p>(<i>The Property Man appears, bows, and looks inquiringly at Chorus, who
hesitates an instant, and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> <i>then, as if fulfilling a rather unpleasant
duty, proceeds.</i>) I would I might ignore the Property Man. He composed a
version of this poetic tale, putting in all the ugly truths, and
serenely forgetting all the possible flower like episodes. As artists we
could not consider it. (<i>Property Man with a slight shrug leaves
stage.</i>) The Property Man is not sufficiently large minded to accept our
ripe and impartial opinion. He is superbly indifferent to the luminous
fruit from his successful rival's quill, and will probably sulk through
his duties. That you may not be disturbed by his presence, we have
clothed him invisibly in black, and you will therefore be spared the
pain of seeing him at all.</p>

<p>I fear I have kept you all too long from the feast prepared for your
delectation. If my brothers behind the curtain show not that histrionic
merit you so rightly demand, I pray you be lenient, and listen with
ears, and see with eyes, not too critical. I conduct you at once to the
moon-lit garden of the wealthy Mandarin, where Chang-sut-yen is
loitering, hoping to meet there the Mandarin's beautiful daughter,
Kwen-lin, who smiles on him. Is it not traditionally the fashion of
women to adore most that youth who is forbidden?</p>

<p>I bow to you for your attentively honorable ears. I bow. I bow.
(<i>Gong-bearer strikes gong. Chorus walks to left of stage, and curtains
are pulled apart, revealing Chang-sut-yen standing before the back
drop.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;(<i>Singing.</i>) <i>Bor lo un doy, bor lo un doy, chin lo, chin
lo, bor lo un doy.</i> Kwen-lin will know that song. It is nothing, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
says nothing, therefore it is pregnant with meaning, and my Bright
Water-lily will understand. (<i>Singing.</i>) <i>Bor lo un doy, bor lo un doy,
chin lo, chin lo, bor lo un doy.</i> She will come, dancing like sun-rays
on the flowers of my mind, and I will press my honorable lips to hers,
and our solemn breaths will mingle. Though I seem but a servant, I am
Chang-sut-yen, son of Chang-won-yin, the Great, ruler of this province.
(<i>Gong-bearer strikes gong.</i>) I am also the most glorious lover the Gods
have made. My soul was fashioned from the wind of Heaven, and the purple
fire of the mountain peak. My illustrious body is the sturdy tree to
which maidens will ever sigh their timid love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus</span>&mdash;It is the Mandarin who walks this way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;(<i>Singing.</i>) <i>Bor lo un doy, bor lo un doy, chin lo, chin
lo, bor lo un doy</i>,&mdash;who comes? Alas, not Kwen-lin the fragrant, but my
master. He will spit anger that I linger in the garden. I must summon my
snake tongue to puzzle his cow-brain, lest he suspect I wait for her. I
will divest myself of my honorable senses, and speak with an empty head.
I will be gloriously fool possessed. (<i>Singing.</i>) <i>Bor lo un doy, bor lo
un doy, chin lo, chin lo, bor lo un doy.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Enter Mandarin.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;The night is full of chill. If the God of Frost bites his
sharp teeth into my fruit trees, they will perish. Br-r-r, cold!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;(<i>Clasping Mandarin in his arms.</i>) August one, the white
moon lady slumbers in the chamber of Heaven, while I wait for you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
light the path of my dreams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Ancestors, save me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;We will make loud prayers to the tablets of our
magnificently worthy ancestors after we embrace. Let me pluck you, and
wear you across my heart, before your flower beauty fades.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;(<i>Recognizing him.</i>) Miserable three footed dog, what maiden
did you think to greet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;I press to my superb breast only your lily feet,
honorable Cherry Blossom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;I am no Cherry Blossom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;You are all the Cherry Blossoms in the Garden of Earth,
shedding perfume and petals with every sighing breeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;I shed nothing but the light of Truth and Justice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;My heart cracks with love for you, and your tasks. At
night when sleep seals the minds of other servants, I journey forth to
count again your dazzling possessions. Your peach trees bend before me,
and I am blinded. I beg to work for you until Death sews a black seam in
my brain, and I go to my ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;You have departed your unhappy wits. I give you to-morrow to
offer gifts to the gods. Pursue sleep, and think not of my possessions,
but rather of your venerable poverty. Your august brain is not large
enough for Death to waste thread on. Thread is costly. Away with you,
and rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;May your golden finger nails grow, and grow, and grow,
until they grasp all wealth and honor. (<i>Singing.</i>) <i>Bor lo un doy, bor</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<i>lo un doy, chin lo, chin lo, bor lo un doy.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Exit Chang, singing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;He is a faithful dog, who begs but a kick to make him lick my
hand. I have given him too many tasks. He is bereft of his toad mind. I
dislike a man who sings as he works. Life does not plan it so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus</span>&mdash;Kwen-lin, Bright Water-Lily, comes to meet her lover.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Kwen-lin, singing. Property Man hands her a branch of
blossoms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;(<i>Singing.</i>) <i>Bor lo un doy, bor lo un doy, chin lo, chin lo,
bor lo un doy.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;The mad one croaked that. (<i>Turns back and sings.</i>) <i>Bor lo un
doy, bor lo un doy, chin lo</i>,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;(<i>Clasping him.</i>) Supreme lover! The happy breezes dance when
your voice is the lute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;My important ears to be so assailed! The world box collapses,
and tumbles round me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;Noble father! I thought it was my&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Your?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;My singing bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;A Cherry Blossom, and a singing bird! An illustrious choice
for a man of high position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;You sound very like a singing bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Something has broken in their heads. Spring has tangled the
brain threads. It must be Spring!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;It is Spring, and soon it will be superb Summer, then Fall,
then Winter. The year gone pff! like that, and miserable life flower
desolated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Before the honorable year goes pff! like that, you will be an
exalted wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;A wife! I, a wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;For seventeen years of moons, your nurses and teachers have
polished you into a state of passable excellence. You are very wonderful
as foolish little girls go. You are something of a somebody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;But to what impressive man are my charms to be presented?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;(<i>Looking at invisible garden.</i>) This late frost will surely
steal the jewels in my garden. The servant Chang must cover the iris. I
can trust Chang.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;You marry me to Chang-sut-yen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Do I throw my child of five thousand and one delectable graces
into the arms of a servant? I was speaking of my garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;If I am to wed, let us speak of husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Ah, many men have sought to wed you, but I have turned their
eyes away, until the sublime one should ask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;To whom do I go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;To the greatest of all! To be dazzled, to be petted, to be
surrounded by every superior luxury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;(<i>Impatiently.</i>) To whom do I go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;There is honor and eminence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> alliance will give me, and
money it will add to my already considerable store. We will not, as a
matter of policy, show we are flattered. We will be proud, we will be
haughty, we will drive a shrewd bargain when the wealthy Ta-yin of
Canton would make you his bride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;The Ta-yin of Canton! I will not marry the Ta-yin of Canton!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;What strange words do your lips produce? Does my daughter
oppose her insect mind to mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;I will not marry the Ta-yin of Canton. He's ugly, he's bold,
he's yellow as&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Gold!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;He shakes when he walks&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;He's a&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;Hundred years old! My heart would crack with grief were I to
marry him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;I never yet heard that any maiden died of grief at the
prospect of being a bride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;Br-r-r-r!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;(<i>Jumping.</i>) What was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;My heart cracking. Death is clutching for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;(<i>Wearily.</i>) Go away, Death. Take her, if you must, after she
is wed. The wealthy Ta-yin can better bear the sad expenses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;I'm dying now, dying, dying. It's quite delicious! (<i>Lies
down. Property Man puts a blue cushion under her head.</i>) I'm almost
dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;You can't die like this. It's most absurd, besides being
unbeautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;Have no fear, my death will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> magnificently beautiful. I
have practiced many times, and know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Get up, fox soul!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;(<i>Sitting up.</i>) Have respect for my solemnly departing life.
My heart will not throb longer. (<i>Lies down.</i>) I am dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;(<i>Prodding her with foot.</i>) Get up, get up, get up! I must
carry her! (<i>Stoops, and puts arms under Kwen-lin.</i>) Oh, for the strong
muscles of my lusty young arms. We have fed her too well. She weighs
many pounds. (<i>Stands up, and claps hands. Chang-sut-yen enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;My serene mind presents itself to you, great master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Sleep should be gathering up the ends of your serene mind, but
it is as well. My daughter's honorable body has persuaded itself to seek
its illustrious ancestors&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;(<i>Kneeling beside Kwen-lin.</i>) Kwen-lin dead, dead! Then
let the lady moon fall from the mighty loft of Heaven, and burn my life
to ashes of wistaria!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Your overwhelming grief at my bereavement becomes a servant,
but let not the pockets of your eyes fill with tears. Bear her to the
house. She shall be whipped alive! (<i>Kwen-lin shudders.</i>) The sublime
wasp shakes at that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;(<i>Bending over Kwen-lin, and looking into her wide open
eyes.</i>) It was a death throe, exalted one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Can your arms support her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;I lift a Cherry Blossom with more effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;Speak not of Cherry Blossoms. Pick her up. (<i>Chang starts to
lift Kwen-lin.</i>) No, no, that is not wise. How shall we do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;(<i>Craftily.</i>) I can guard the crystal vase of her
departed soul, while you go for help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandarin</span>&mdash;It had not penetrated my disturbed brain. I go for help.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit Mandarin.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;(<i>Sitting up.</i>) Superb love mate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;(<i>Hurriedly.</i>) Augustly enter the world of the venerable
dead again, luscious one, your honorable father looks this way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;(<i>Lying down.</i>) Do your eyes grow pearls that I am with my
ancestors?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;The love butterflies are winging in the happy recesses of
my heart. My breath will smother me with joy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;(<i>Sitting up.</i>) Joy, when my father is going to marry me to
the Ta-yin of Canton?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;Exalted joy, because before that can happen my father
will have the Ta-yin beheaded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;An orphan has no father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;I have a celestial now and then father, who does these
necessary but disagreeable things. I think he will dispose of the
wealthy Ta-yin if I ask him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;It must be a wonderful convenience. We will make a list of all
those superbly annoying persons we do not like, and have your celestial
now and then father, behead them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;We will ponder it, Bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> Water-lily, when we are not
serenely happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;I do not like being whipped alive! My teeth chatter when I
think of it, and I can't be happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang-sut-yen</span>&mdash;A base whip to touch you! Nay, my lips shall make you
live. (<i>Kisses her.</i>) I am gloriously versed in lip magic. (<i>Kisses her
again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwen-lin</span>&mdash;Let us fly on our illustrious legs, and be married with the

Kwen-lin, and each has added a white hibiscus blossom to the garland of
life. But now bitter winter comes, snow is on the paeony hill, the hosts
of evil are abroad. The Mandarin, with never ending rage, has spent the
months searching throughout the Empire to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> their dwelling
place. Now he has learned where it is, and pursues Chang-sut-yen with a
death dealing thong, which he will wield with dire results. It is the
pleasure of the illustrious author that the villain act in a supremely
unpleasant manner, in order to bring out the tenderness of the play. Our
lovers, not knowing this is a comedy, (and therefore must conclude with
smiles and feasting), are overwhelmed with fear. I beg you not to share
this fear, except inasmuch as it may make the after enjoyment of the
happy ending more piquant and superbly satisfying.</p>

there. My heart is strong, and I can wait for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>&mdash;My heart was strong and passionate; it pulses no longer like a
man's, but serves to beat out the unconsidered tickings of the ashen
days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Then sit with me, be a child, and laugh at the shadow. So faith may
come again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>&mdash;The day is breaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;(<i>Whimsically.</i>) Alas, the shadow's gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>

there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Have you been there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>&mdash;No.... I dreamed and thought to reach it once, but lost the way.</p>

<p>(<i>They climb together.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Why do you laugh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>&mdash;My blood has turned to flame. I feel it burning in my body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>&mdash;(<i>Whispering.</i>) Your land of promise!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;It is not so! My land of promise is more beautiful than anything
one may imagine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>&mdash;This is more beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;I would know if this were it.</p>

devil has gone. I have found the place and myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Not so! The place is farther off, and higher. I am not content with
this!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>&mdash;Come with me, youth, to the summit!</p>

and clean. Door L leads to kitchen. Door R leads to front door. Mrs.
Quinn is seated at centre table darning socks and talking to her
neighbor, Mrs. Martin.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Dropping a few pennies into a purse, and shutting it with
a snap.</i>) Seven weeks, and not one cent coming in. I don't know how
we'll live, if it keeps up much longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;A strike's a bitter thing Mrs. Martin, and no one knowin'
how it will end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;Why can't they talk it out? It seems to me if the motormen
and conductors sent a committee to the company, they might arrive at an
understanding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;But the company don't take stock in the Union, and a
committee of men would be a Union committee, or nothin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;Let them arbitrate, I say, let them arbitrate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;It's a nice soundin' word, is arbitrate, but no one wants to
do it, save them as ain't interested. A man hits with his fist first,
and arbitrates afterwards,&mdash;in the police court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;Men are queer creatures. There's my Bill, a more religious
man never walked, if I do say it myself, and yet he's as bitter as
poison against the company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Religion don't always kill bitterness&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;This morning I wakened up before five o'clock, and he
wasn't in bed. I went down stairs to see what had happened, and found
him sneaking in the back gate like a thief. Heaven only knows what he
was doing outside at that time in the morning. Mischief, I'll bet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Aye, it was mischief, and my old man in it too. I got it out
of John when he came back. They had been out before the dawn, pryin' up
trolley tracks with a crow-bar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Martin</span>&mdash;A fine mess if they'd been caught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Locked up, that's what would have happened, nice pair of old
fools that they are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;It must be devilish though, to have strike breakers come in
and run the cars, while the men are sticking out for a principle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;A principle's a fine excuse now and then, for a bunch of men
to fight behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;But this is a principle worth fighting for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Maybe it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;I wish you'd go to the lectures at the Lyceum with me.
You'd understand things better. My, I miss your Molly. We heard so many
wonderful men talk, and she was so quick getting their ideas, it was
just great to be with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Well, you know, she'd <i>tell</i> me about them when she got
home. I remember that first man who talked of the virtue of humility and
self-sacrifice. Molly was that full of onselfishness after hearin' him,
that she almost gave her job to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> Jennie Tubbs, thinkin' <i>she</i> needed the
money more than we did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;That was Prof. William Mason. He was a noble character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Aye, but he didn't last. He was followed by the moral
uplifter one. Sure, we lived on pins and needles then! After him we had
a course in sanitation, and pure food, and how to feed a fam'ly of six
on $4.00 a week. Oh, them last was wonderful fairy tales. The meals that
woman could manufacture out of an old ham bone! It was past belief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;I tried a few of her receipts, but Bill wouldn't eat the
things I made. He said he wasn't a horse yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Aw, she was a joker, I'm thinkin', put in the pack to
lighten the others up a bit. Lectures is an easy way of gettin' scraps
of learnin', but it's done neither of ye lastin' hurt that I can see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;I heard the walking delegate talk this afternoon. The men
got pretty excited listening to him. He told them their rights, and
it'll be a wonder to me, if they don't do a good bit of damage to the
Company's property before this thing ends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;The walkin' delegate's a smart lad, from all I hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;He's smart enough to get paid for the work he does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;He gets paid for startin' strikes, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;He goes all over the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> telling the men when to
strike, and what to strike for. He gets paid for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;But the men don't get paid for strikin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;That's a silly idea, Mrs. Quinn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;You can have it for what it's worth. Molly used to say I had
more ideas than a dog has fleas, but I fancy she was just slatherin' me
over with the blarney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;Well, I believe the walking delegate's right. The men must
fight this out to a finish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;It's likely to be our finish, alright, alright.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Unconsciously imitating the delegate.</i>) It's not only for
ourselves, but for our children that the war must be waged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Our children! Sure, it shouldn't be a bequeathment job, this
trolley business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;He says our children will be saved a fight for their
rights, if we conquer now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Whist darlin', our children will have their own notion of
rights and fights by the time they grow up. They can blow on their own
broth when it bubbles over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;But the noble way is to consider the ones who come after
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Maybe that's so, me dear Mrs. Martin, but I'm after lookin'
out for the man of to-day. The better off we are, the better off our
kids'll be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;The walking delegate says that's a very selfish way of
looking at it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;The walkin' delegate's got the fine words in his mouth.</p>

<p>(<i>Silence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;Have you heard from Molly lately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Poor darlin', I got a letter from her this mornin'. She's
comin' home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;Does Mr. Quinn know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;I'll have it out with him to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;He's a pretty stubborn man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;I'll bring him around, never fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;I think you're a wonderful woman, the way you manage him,
Mrs. Quinn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Sure it's just me knowledge of that, keeps me goin'. When I
lose conceit of meself, I'll be fit for no place but&mdash;Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Listens, with finger uplifted.</i>) Sh! That's Bill slamming
the back gate. I'll go put the kettle on. A cup of hot tea soon takes
all the ugly kinks out of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;It's an upliftin' beverage, is tea. It does miracles for my
old man, when he has his back up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Going to door L. then hesitating.</i>) I'm not a specially
religious woman, Mrs. Quinn, and I've never heard you say much about it,
but I think now that everything else has failed and the strike seems no
nearer an end, we might as well take it to God in prayer. As Bill says,
we've tried every other way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Slowly.</i>) Well, I guess Gawd's used to bein' the last on
the list, so I'll join ye in yer prayers, Mrs. Martin. Good-night to
ye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>(<i>Exit Mrs Martin door L.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. Quinn pulls down the blind and fusses about the room. There is a

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Reads&mdash;then.</i>) Nothin' but strike, strike, strike,

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Nothin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Tartly.</i>) Well, it's a fine husky way for a man to be
makin' a livin' for his wife, throwin' up his good job as a motorman,

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Moodily.</i>) Good job,&mdash;hell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;I don't see what way ye'll pay for shoe leather, if ye don't
get some money soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;We'll live. The Union won't see us go under for the lack of a

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;I don't like livin' on the Union.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;We ain't beggars yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Springing up.</i>) Stop that infernal noise! Seems like a man

day, with me legs and head that tired I'm ready to drop, and when I get
home at night, a clatter that would wake the dead, in me ears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Yer blood may be Irish, John Quinn, but yer nerves are
American.... I never saw such a changed man in me life. It's bad enough
to have ye walk out on strike&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Now see here, I didn't walk out on strike, and ye know it. I'd be
workin' yet if the Union hadn't told us to lay off until we got our
rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Ye'll rot before ye get yer rights, I'm thinkin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Maybe, maybe so.</p>

<p>(<i>Silence again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Putting down paper.</i>) I see the walking delegate discussed
the strike at an elegant banquet at the Hotel Hoffman last night. Ye
know, <i>he</i> don't seem to suffer no privation. Mrs. Martin says he gets a
princely wage for orderin' strikes all over the country. No wonder he's
in earnest about his job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Some one has to lead the men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;I fancy he wouldn't lead far, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> his wage stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Shortly.</i>) Aw, don't be a fool.</p>

<p>(<i>Silence again. Quinn moves uneasily in his chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;What's on yer mind? Can't ye sit still?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;What should be on me mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;I haven't lived with ye five and twenty years without
knowin' when ye've done somethin' ye're ashamed of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;I've done nothin' I'm ashamed of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Out with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>After a slight hesitation.</i>) I walked down town to-night to see
the sights. Bill Martin went with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Content to get her knowledge by Quinn's roundabout way of
telling it.</i>) Were the streets crowded?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Nothin' like they are up here.... D'ye know they have the State
Constabulary on the Avenue now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;I saw them this mornin'. Big hulkin' brutes they are,
chargin' into groups of women and children like as if they were
offenders agin the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;It's makin' the men see red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;If the men are wise, they'll give them a wide berth, and not
start any ructions, or they'll get smashed heads for their pains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Well, we can smash heads, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;And be put in the lock-up for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Am I in the lock-up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Quickly.</i>) Whose head have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> <i>you</i> smashed John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;To-night while we stood at the corner of Fourth and Marion, a
trolley came along with passengers in it, a woman and two men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;John, ye didn't&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;The dirty scab who ran the car must have come from New York with
that last bunch of strike breakers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;What did ye do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Defiantly.</i>) I picked up a brick, and let it fly through the
window. Maybe the company can starve us, but we'll teach the public it's
a damned unsafe thing to ride in the cars, while we're bein' starved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Did ye do any hurt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Well, I guess I damaged the woman's arm, if ye want to know. She
let out a yell ye could hear a mile, and flopped over. Then I took to me
heels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>In a rage.</i>) Ye fool, have ye quite quit yer senses? Ye'll
be caught and locked up fer this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Glad that he has gotten the story out.</i>) Not much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Yer temper'll do fer ye, one of these days, me man. I
suppose that's what ye call seem' red? Seein' red! Gawd'll get ye by the
scruff of the neck when yer not lookin', and shake the ugly devil of a
temper out of ye. Ye'll face the consequence for it, sooner or later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Aw, stop yer blather, and get me a cup of tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Tea! I'm tempted to put a pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> bean in it, and make ye
croak before the gallows gets ye, ye ruffian.</p>

<p>(<i>There is a knock at the front door. Mrs. Quinn exits R. and returns
with the Martins.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Hello Martin, what's up now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;Have ye seen the papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;It's in them already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;What's in them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;Listen, (<i>reads</i>) "Just at dusk this evening a mob of strikers
attacked a west bound car at Fourth and Marion Streets, and did
considerable damage to the car and occupants. The only woman passenger
was seriously injured in the right hand and arm, and was taken to the
Lester Hospital, where"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Interrupting.</i>) Do they know who done it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Reads.</i>) "No clue to the man has been found, but Chief of
Police"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Shortly.</i>) Aw, cut it, Martin. They'll never find the man who
did it, unless your tongue wags. I'd like to break the arms of ev'ry one
who runs or rides in the cars till we win our fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Somberly.</i>) Maybe the only way <i>is</i> to do a little damage,
break a few bones, show them we've got some spunk ... and yet it is
written if a man smite thee on the right cheek&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;I thought the plan this time was to keep the confidence of
the people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;We've tried that for seven weeks, and it's taken us nowheres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;We've tried most everything I guess, but prayer. Maybe we'd
do more if we prayed over it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Slowly.</i>) Do ye say pray over it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Diffidently.</i>) If we could all get together on it. I know it's
hard to talk religion to the boys, they all think different about it. It
takes some courage for a man to come out and say he's a Christian, but
I'm willing to do it. Think&mdash;if all the men and women and children would
pray for a settlement, it would have some weight with the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Eagerly.</i>) He'd give an answer, I know. I heard a
minister say once, if we'd ask for <i>anything</i> with all our hearts and
souls the Lord wouldn't deny us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;What a mix-up we'd have then!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Well, I've not much use for prayers when there's a fight on&mdash;but
if ye&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Ye know, I had a mad sort of a dream tother night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Impatiently.</i>) Whist woman, with yer dreams!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Undeterred.</i>) I dreamed I was after havin' a nice easy
talk with Gawd, and he sez to me, "Mary Ann Quinn, I want ye to sit up
here with me in Heaven on me right hand side. For sure," sez he,
pleasant like, "<i>you've</i> never pestered me with requests since ye've
been a woman grown." "Well Gawd," sez I, "I've been that mortal busy
tendin' to the bodily comforts of me man John, and me daughter Molly,
that I've had me mind fair occupied, and I apologize for not comin' to
ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> oftener." "Oh, Mary Ann," sez he, "can't ye see I like it? I'm fair
sick of havin' to stand sponsor for all the mistakes of me numberless
Christian children. They go along in their headstrong ways doin' the
things they <i>want</i> to do, right or wrong, and when they run amuck, they
up and come to <i>me</i> with prayers and supplications, cryin' and pleadin'
for help, when a slight use of their own wits and decency and common
sense would have kept them from difficulties in the first place."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gawd," begins I, but he smiles at me and sez he, "get up wid ye on
me right hand side, and keep that grin on yer face Mary Ann Quinn, while
I tend to me regular customers."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Shocked.</i>) I can't help ye bein' heathenish in yer views, but
I'll not have ye outspoken voicin' them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Puzzled.</i>) It was a very odd dream to have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;It certainly was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;The meanin' of it's mortal clear, I'm thinkin'. But, that's
not gettin' the tea, is it?</p>

<p>(<i>Exit to kitchen L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Martin, I don't know about yer prayers, but fer meself I'm in
this fight till the finish, and man nor devil'll make me yield an inch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;Then I'm with you, Quinn. (<i>To Mrs. Martin, who goes to him
protestingly.</i>) No, Bessie, its no use. We can <i>pray</i> after we've won.</p>

<p>(<i>Molly enters door R. She is in hat and coat, and carries a muff.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span>&mdash;Molly!</p>

<p>(<i>Molly does not answer, but stands and looks</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> <i>at Quinn.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>&mdash;(<i>Taking Mrs Martin by the arm, and going to door R.</i>) I guess
you'd rather be alone with her.</p>

<p>(<i>Exeunt Martins door R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Father.</p>

<p>(<i>Quinn rises and looks at her, but does not speak.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Slowly.</i>) Two years ago when you married that damned fiddler, I
told ye never to come here again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Sternly.</i>) I meant it then, and I mean it now. Get out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Won't you let me speak to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;There's nothin' you can say to me, I gave you yer choice of us
long ago, and ye stuck to him. Stick to him now, I don't want ye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Enters door L with tea things.</i>) Molly, my dear little
Molly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Ignoring Quinn.</i>) Sit down now, and I'll give ye a dish of
tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;She'll not sit down in this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Easily, tho her heart is beating rapidly.</i>) Will she not?
Here, take off yer hat and coat, and drink this while it's hot. I'll
bring another cup for yer father.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit to kitchen. Molly remains standing, and faces her father. She
makes no attempt to remove her wraps.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Won't you let me come back to you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> mother? Won't you forgive
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Slowly.</i>) Why are ye so eager to be back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;I need you and mother, now I'm alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Quickly.</i>) Alone? He's left ye, has he?</p>

<p>(<i>Molly unable to answer for her tears, nods head.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;The things I told you about him were true then? He was no fit man
to marry a decent girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Father, father, don't say that!</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. Quinn enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Working himself into a rage.</i>) The fine gentleman has left
Molly. All his grand love makin' to end in two years, tho Gawd knows I
didn't expect it to last that long. (<i>To Molly.</i>) Why hadn't ye sense
enough not to be gulled by him? Didn't I tell ye, he was a rogue and a
scoundrel? Chucked aside for another woman, I suppose ye were! Left ye,
left ye&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Ye blunderin' idiot, last Tuesday the boy died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Helplessly.</i>) Died? I&mdash;I thought&mdash;(<i>to Molly.</i>) Sit down&mdash;drink
the tea.... Is&mdash;is there an egg for her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;There's no eggs here. The hens went on strike with the
trolley men. Let me help you off with yer coat, Molly. What have ye done
to yer arm? What's that bandage on yer arm for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;You remember, I told you in my last letter, mother&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Sourly.</i>) So ye've been writin', hev ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;D'ye think a mother will let her only child slip easily out
of her heart and life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;(<i>Pleading.</i>) Mother, father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>With poor grace.</i>) Aw, well, let it go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;(<i>Sitting at back of table, Quinn and Mrs. Quinn at either
side.</i>) When I settled up everything, after&mdash;after his death, I planned
to go back to my old job. I went to the office and saw Mr. Bowen, and he
said the place was still open for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Admiringly.</i>) I don't wonder he's glad to get ye back.
There ain't many stenographers clever as you are Molly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Be quiet mother, and let the girl talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;I knew if I could work, and bring good wages into the house,
father could afford to stay out on strike until the men had won.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Molly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;I <i>did</i> plan for that father, I did plan for that, and now&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Well, go on, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;To-night at the Lester Hospital when they fixed my arm, the
doctor said I couldn't use it before a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;What happened to it? How did ye hurt it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;I did the wrong thing, and I guess I deserve what I got, but I
was dog tired and the walk here is endless. I took a car at the ferry,
everything went all right till we got to Fourth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> Marion Streets&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Startled.</i>) Fourth and Marion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;There was a crowd of strikers there, and one of them threw a
brick into the car, and it struck my arm at the elbow. Crushed it pretty
badly, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;My Gawd!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;(<i>Misunderstanding his emotion.</i>) I'm not going to live on you,
father. I know you and mother are hard enough pushed as it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;What's ours is yours now. Ye'll stay here with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Dazed.</i>) I wonder can I get a job at Newton's? They needed men
last week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Father, he ... left insurance, and we can use that until you
start again, or until I'm able to go back to the office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;The strike's a mistake, I'm thinkin'. I'll go to the barn
to-morrow and take me car out, if the boys kill me for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;(<i>Quickly, and unconsciously imitating Mrs. Martin's
imitation of the walking delegate.</i>) Ye'll do no such thing. The
strike's on till it's settled. Yer fightin' fer a principle, and ye'll
not give in till ye win. This is not a war for us only, but for our
children. <i>They'll</i> be saved a fight fer their rights if we conquer now.
We'll go at the company in the way that that walking delegate says. (<i>As
she becomes conscious she is quoting the quoted delegate.</i>) The walking
delegate? Well, he's alright, we'll do things his way, and we'll win.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;Of course we'll win. Public sympathy is with the men this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;Well, it won't be fer long, if the men see red, and go about
bustin' up perfectly good arms of innocent bystanders. Me mind's made
up, violence must stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;And mine's made up too, the strike must be won.</p>

<p>(<i>Quinn goes to wail rack, and takes down hat and coat.</i>)</p>

<p>What are ye doin' with yer coat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinn</span>&mdash;I'll go and have a talk with the boys. I've some power with them.
Violence must stop. I'll try to make them listen to reason, and if they
won't, I guess I'm good for a job at Newton's.</p>

<p>(<i>As he leaves room he is heard muttering.</i>) Violence must stop!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;I never knew father so set against a fight. What's he want to
work in a coal yard for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;Never fear, he won't work in a coal yard. Ye see Molly he's
awful mad at the man who smashed yer arm. It makes him wild to think a
fellow is free to go about harmin' innocent people, just because he
thinks he sees red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly</span>&mdash;I hope he never finds the man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Quinn</span>&mdash;D'ye know, I think he has a hunch who did it. Oh, he won't
hurt him! Father's been gettin' close to some hard home facts this day,
and a good walk in the fresh night air will help him to digest them.</p>

<p>(<i>As curtain descends.</i>) I'm so sorry about yer poor arm. Tell me, does
it hurt you much?&mdash;etc.</p>

<p><i>Scene&mdash;Interior of a frame restaurant in the park. At the left side,
running almost the entire width of the room, is the counter at which one
may buy soft-drinks, peanuts, pop-corn, newspapers, etc. A talking
machine and telephone are on counter. Against the wall, at centre back,
is a screen, behind it is a door to another room. At the right side,
back, a table and couple of chairs. Small table and two chairs near
front of stage, left. When curtain rises, Miss Brown and The Boy are
discovered. Miss Brown is a red haired, good-hearted, sharp tongued old
maid of uncertain years; positive in her opinions, quick in bodily
action&mdash;giving one the impression of great nervous energy. The Boy is
the typical roguish, rather fresh, "newsy" of fifteen, or thereabout.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;Ye young snipe, can't ye see I'm ready to drop?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Aw, stop coddlin' yerself! Yer good for a mile yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>Pulling herself free.</i>) You run and get the papers. It's
almost dark, and there ain't one here yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;(<i>At victrola.</i>) Well, I'm goin,' ain't I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>Out of breath.</i>) Quit foolin' with that machine, and go
get yer papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;I won't be three minutes, and then we can try it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;I think I've had enough. It ain't no game for an old hen.</p>

<p>(<i>Boy puts on sweater and cap.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;Is it four slow, and four fast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;No, that ain't right. Four slow, eight fast, then two turnin'
steps. See? (<i>Shows steps, then exits.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>Meditatively.</i>) If I get goin' I suppose I'll be dotty,
like the rest. This dance craze is certainly worse than hittin' up the
booze. They say that Lizzie Smith, the hussy, roped that poor misguided
Jones boy into marrying her with her dancing, though heaven knows I
never saw nothin' in her grace or beauty. Oh, for ten years of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>

figure! (<i>Puts record on machine, and dances hesitatingly, counting

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;Can't ye see where yer goin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Fumbling in pocket.</i>) Here. Sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;A dollar! Ye never can tell a millionaire by looks these

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Impatiently.</i>) Oh, shut up!</p>

<p>(<i>Boy, grumbling and muttering to himself, helps Miss Brown pick up the
peanuts and papers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>With great displeasure.</i>) This is a nice out of the way place to
bring a man to. What's wrong with you anyway? Drunk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Grimly.</i>) I haven't been sober for three days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Don't boast about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Boast, good heavens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;What do you think a newspaper is, a day nursery? Here's Billy
Sunday in town, the war, the Mexican situation, everything at boiling
point; the Gazette short of men, and you off on a three days' jag! I've
a good mind to fire you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Miserably.</i>) I'm up against it, King, don't rub it in. I don't
know which way to turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;(<i>To Miss Brown, as they seat themselves behind counter.</i>) I wish
those ginks would clear out, so we could trot again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;What have you done, a second story job?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>With much humility, and some pride.</i>) I've broken a girl's

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Utterly disgusted.</i>) Oh, hell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I tell you, I've broken a girl's heart, and ruined her life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Rubbish! Sober up, and go back to work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I can't. She has threatened to do something desperate. There will
be a scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Forget it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I wish I could, but suppose she shoots herself, or takes poison?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;That sounds pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I didn't know she loved me, I protest I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Cut out the heroics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;She's mad about me, and I didn't understand till too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Firmly.</i>) Too late! You scuttle back to town, get a license, and
marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I came to the city to earn money to marry a girl back home, and
I'll marry her, or no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Winning a girl's love, and throwing her over, is cheap sport. I'm
disappointed in you, Bart. I didn't know you were that kind of a chap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I'm not that kind. It's all a horrible mistake. She misunderstood
my&mdash;my attentions. I was just nice and friendly to her, and she, well
she&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;That's right, put the blame on her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Hotly.</i>) Well, I'm not going to blame myself. If women see fit
to fall in love with me, it's not my fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;You conceited pup!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I don't care. I've suffered enough these last three days, and I've
just about gone to pieces. It's not my fault, I don't care what you say,
it's not my fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Every cad says it's not his fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>To Boy.</i>) What in the name of common sense are they
gassin' about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Aw, they're holdin' hands, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>To King.</i>) I asked you here for advice, not abuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Shortly.</i>) You have my advice, marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;And I tell you I won't. I don't love her, and I do love Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Lucy. The girl up home, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;What will she think of this mess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;She need never know that Selina existed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Starting.</i>) Selina!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;That's her name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Selina, what a coincidence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I thought you'd understand, and help me out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Tell me, I'll try to understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>To Boy.</i>) My Gawd, ain't they never goin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Talk about yer cheap skates!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>To King.</i>) I've been kind of lonely down here in the city, and
she was a regular oasis in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> the desert. I took her to a good many first
nights, and the opera pretty nearly every week, and she&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Gently ironical.</i>) Gazette passes, I presume?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;You don't think I could pay for them out of my salary, do you?
I've not had a cent from father since I left home.... She always gets
herself up well, and wears good-looking clothes, and I felt proud to
take her around. Besides, she's older than I am, and I thought I was
safe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;I had no idea you were so irresistible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>To Boy.</i>) It's time to give them the acid test. (<i>She
turns a sign advertising Coca Cola, with its face to the wall. On the
back is printed in large letters, "This ain't no free rest room. Buy
something, or get out." King turns around, glances at the sign casually,
then gives his attention to Bart.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Hully gee! The big boob can't read!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;What's a poor girl to do now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>To King.</i>) Why, I never even kissed her, although once or twice,
I think she wanted me to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;With such a platonic background, how did you manage to break her
heart?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;That's the queer part. Tuesday night after Tosca, we had a little
supper at her apartments. We were talking about friendship, and I told
her what a bully little pal she had been, and how I'd miss our good
times when I went home and married Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;You mentioned Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Why shouldn't I?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;<i>I</i> should call it a strategic error.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I suppose it was a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;It's rank idiocy, my boy, to tell one woman you love another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;It seemed to break her all up. She declared I'd led her to believe
I was going to marry <i>her</i>, that she had given her heart unreservedly to
me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Quickly.</i>) She had "given her heart unreservedly to you?" Did
she use those words?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I'm not apt to forget them, especially as she repeated everything
half a dozen times. She made me feel as if I'd deserted her at the
altar. I tell you, I never went through such an awful hour in my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Didn't you explain to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Explain to a weeping woman? She was lost in an ocean of tears, I'd
have had to use a foghorn. I got so rattled I began to cry myself. Then
she flung herself in my arms, and said if I jilted her (jilted her, mind
you!) she'd blow her brains out. And she'll do it, too, she'll do it.
That's what I'm afraid of. If Selina kills herself for love of me, it's
all up with Lucy; she'll never marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Does anyone know of this scene?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Her maid came in while she was sobbing in my arms. I tried to
shake her off, but she clung like a leech.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Her maid, that's bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Moodily.</i>) I know it's bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Are you sure you never made her think you loved her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I protest on my word of honor, I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> even hinted at love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;(<i>To Miss Brown, as he yawns over newspaper.</i>) There's nothin'
worth readin' except this blame suicide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>Looking up from her newspaper.</i>) It certainly gets my goat
the way some fool women go dippy over men.</p>

<p>(<i>King glances at Miss Brown suddenly, as she raises her voice during
her last remark, then turns to Bart.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Have you seen the papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I've been afraid to look at them for fear of reading something
about her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Turning to counter.</i>) Bring me a Gazette, boy. (<i>Hands coin.</i>)
No change. Go along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;(<i>Impudently.</i>) The woods is full of 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Looking at paper.</i>) I guess you're in for it, Bart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>In a stifled voice.</i>) What&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;This suicide. I never connected it with you. The body of an
unknown woman was found at the Riverton dam this afternoon. She was
about thirty-eight years old, five feet five, had light brown hair&mdash;does
that fit your Selina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I don't think Selina was more than five feet three or four, and
she can't be thirty. She told me herself she was only twenty-six. (<i>Puts
out a shaking hand for the paper.</i>) Let me see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Holding paper.</i>) The newspaper description may not be accurate
Bart, but all her underclothing was marked with initials. That is the
clue the police are working on.</p>

<p>(<i>Hands paper to Bart, pointing out the place.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>Reading her newspaper.</i>) Poor soft soul, it's certainly
awful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Clutching his head.</i>) Great heavens! She left a note. "I did it
for love, <i>he</i> will understand. S. W." She's dead, she's dead, there's
blood on my hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Pull yourself together. Don't make a scene here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I've killed her just as surely as if I'd thrown her into the water
myself. I'm a murderer, that's what I am. I've murdered Selina!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Sit down, and listen to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Murderer, Selina's murderer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Sit down! We must work this out together quietly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Bitterly.</i>) Be quiet with a murder on my conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>To Boy, folding up her newspaper.</i>) Well I ain't seen the
man, I'd kill myself for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>To Bart.</i>) I'm going to tell you something no one in all the
world knows except me, and a poor heart broken old woman in New
Hampshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Don't talk to me. I'm a murderer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Whispering.</i>) So am I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Jumping.</i>) What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;That's what I want to tell you about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;You too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Eight years ago, I trifled with a woman, just as you have done. I
was more to blame than you, for I made her think I loved her. She loved
<i>me</i>, there was no doubt about that, but I thought she was after my
money, and that of course, ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> everything. I quarrelled with her, and
went about my business. She left the city. A month later I received a
letter from her mother. She told me her daughter had died in her arms of
a broken heart. Her last words were, "I have given my heart unreservedly
to him." My name was the last she ever breathed. And the poor old lady
was left alone and penniless. I would have gone to her at once, but she
could not bear the shock of seeing her daughter's murderer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;What a coincidence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;It does not end there, for she was called Selina!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Amazed.</i>) Selina!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;A tragic coincidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Both of us murderers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Murderers, yes, we have murdered our Selinas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>To Boy.</i>) Merciful heavens, they've killed someone!
(<i>Takes down telephone, and calls.</i>) Main 674 ... 674 I said. Say
operator, you get me Main 674 will ye? Oh, stop polishing yer nails, you
ain't no society dame.... Is this 674? Send a cop quick to Miss Brown's
restaurant. Someone's been murdered, and the men who done it ... here in
my restaurant. I ain't stringin' ye ... right away. I don't like bein'
alone with them. (<i>Hangs receiver up, and watches Bart and King
closely.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>To King.</i>) What did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;What could I do? From the day of her death until now, I've kept
her mother. It's the only reparation I can make, and I have done it for
eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Tragically.</i>) My Selina was alone in the world. With her death I
have blotted out an entire family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Humbly.</i>) We possibly can't help being handsome and fascinating,
Bart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;But we must learn to be careful with women, and not lead them on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>To Boy.</i>) Now you sit tight, and if they come over here,
brain them with a soda water bottle.... (<i>Looks out of doorway.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;(<i>Dancing with excitement and pleasure.</i>) Ain't this some picnic!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>To Bart.</i>) I have never dared look at a woman since then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I can't imagine Lucy killing herself for me. She will never love
me as Selina did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Sighing.</i>) Selina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Mine.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter a plain clothes Officer, and a Policeman, breathlessly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;(<i>To Miss Brown.</i>) Now, which one of them done it?</p>

<p>(<i>Takes out revolver.</i>) You too, Miss Brown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> the chief'll want your
testimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>To Boy.</i>) Watch the Caf, while I'm gone, and don't you
give nobody nothin'.</p>

<p>(<i>Exeunt Bart, King, Miss Brown, Officer and Policeman. Boy puts record
on machine, and before starting it, says, "Gee, life's great!" then
dances to the music, stopping when Selina and Gentleman, in evening
attire, appear at the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;It's too bad the tire's punctured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Graciously.</i>) I really don't mind it in the least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Really.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;A car's such a rotten nuisance. Always something wrong with
it; much rather ride in a hack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Coquettishly.</i>) Even a hack would have no terrors with you,
though I confess, I prefer the machine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;We'll be late for dinner, too. It will take Thompson half an
hour to put on that tire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Then let's sit here, look at the moon, and talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;About the moon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Oh dear no,&mdash;about you and me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;About you, you're such a ripping sort. Maybe I can get
something to drink while we wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Do, I'm chilled to the bone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Boy, let us have two cups of fresh hot coffee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;You gotta wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Wait, why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;The lady's out. I can't make cawfee. I'm just mindin' the shop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;You get us something to drink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Aw, this is a temperance joint.</p>

<p>(<i>Grins impudently at the Gentleman, who stares at him with great
disdain for an instant, then turns to Selina.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Botheration! I suppose we might as well stay out of the cold
until Thompson is ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;There's a draft along there. Don't sit too near the wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;I'll fix the draft with this screen. (<i>Places screen across
one corner of room.</i>) That will keep that fresh kid from seeing us, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Why don't you want the boy to see? What are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Well, for one thing, kiss you, if I get the chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Severely.</i>) I think you are forgetting yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;(<i>Confusedly.</i>) I beg your pardon. My tongue slipped. I
wanted to ask you to, to&mdash;I'll take a look at Thompson.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit Gentleman. Boy makes a smacking noise with his lips.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Um, honey!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Behind screen, exultingly.</i>) It'll be easy enough to work him.
He's ready to drop into my hand now, like a ripe plum. Lord, what fools
men are!</p>

<p>(<i>Boy puts on record, and starts machine. Selina listens a moment, then
picks up her skirt, and does a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> <i>few steps behind screen. Bart and King
enter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Stop that infernal racket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Big stiff. (<i>Does not stop machine.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Where's my cane?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;You gotta wait till Miss Brown comes back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;You get my cane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;(<i>Picking cane up from counter, and hiding it behind him.</i>) I don't
know where she put it. You gotta wait, see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>To Bart.</i>) I'd like to jump that cop. Nice fix for us if Mason
hadn't been there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;(<i>Stopping machine.</i>) Say, didn't you do it? What did they let you
come back for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Of course we didn't do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>To King.</i>) And yet we <i>are</i> guilty of murder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Luckily for us, the law won't see it that way.... I'll double my
allowance to her mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;And I'll put flowers every week on my Selina's grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;We are bound together by ties of death. We must be brave, and face
the world serenely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Clasping King's hand.</i>) And no one must know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Peeping around screen.</i>) George King and Bart! My gosh, what a
pickle! (<i>She hurriedly enters the little room back of the screen. Bart
and King just catch a glimpse of her as she disappears.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Sh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Great heavens, an apparition!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;She has come to haunt me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I shall throw myself at her ghostly feet, and crave pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart and King</span>&mdash;(<i>With outstretched hands.</i>) Selina!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Tragically.</i>) That was the spirit of the Selina whom my coldness
killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;It was the spirit of my Selina, who drowned herself for love of
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;How terrible is the vengeance of heaven! It makes the one woman
haunt us both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;I shall go mad now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Bart, I feel my reason tottering.</p>

<p>(<i>They sit at little table, heads on hands, backs to the entrance door.
Gentleman enters, and goes behind screen.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;It will take about ten minutes more&mdash;hello, where have you
gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Peeping from room off stage.</i>) Sh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Why, what's the mystery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Did you see two men in there, as you came in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Didn't notice, but I'll take a look.</p>

<p>(<i>Bart and King hide behind counter when Gentleman appears.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Not a soul but the boy. (<i>Returns to Selina, who comes into
the room, but remains behind screen. Bart and King stay behind counter,
but listen intently to Selina and Gentleman.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Something queer about this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>To Gentleman.</i>) Flatterer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;I remember the first time I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> you at the opera. By the
way, who's that chap you always go with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Lightly.</i>) Oh, that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Her voice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;He interests me. Seems very sweet on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;I have eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;He's just a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;It's these young cubs who always run off with the prizes. Are
you in love with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;I do not think you have any right to question me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;I beg your pardon for seeming impertinent. I merely ask, so I
may know where I stand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Do you think <i>he</i> is the type of man I could love? Frankly, he
bores me to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Great fish!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;I don't think you bore him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Sadly.</i>) Poor boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;He's gone on you, isn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Pleadingly.</i>) Please don't think me a heartless coquette. He's
alone here in the city. I was just nice and friendly to him, and the
poor fellow's fallen desperately in love with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;(<i>Gallantly.</i>) I don't blame him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;That's quite sweet of you, but it's made me very unhappy. He was
engaged to a girl up the state, and I'm afraid she will blame me. Women
are so cruel in their judgments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;(<i>Soothingly.</i>) Well if you don't love him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;How can I? Yet I'm worried sick, for he has threatened to kill
himself if I don't marry him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Springing up hysterically.</i>) Liar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>With deep conviction.</i>) She's no ghost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>To Gentleman.</i>) Do you wonder I am unhappy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;You certainly couldn't throw yourself away on a young puppy
like him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Clenching fists.</i>) Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Sit down!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;He hasn't been at his office since I refused him. I'm afraid
he's done something desperate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Don't worry about him. What you want is a man with position
and wealth. Now, if <i>I</i> should say I loved you, and wanted to marry you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Quietly.</i>) But you have not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;(<i>With an embarrassed laugh.</i>) I'm trying to hard enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Shall I say, "this is so sudden?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Heavens, no, not that stuff! Say "yes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;But I'm not used to this sort of proposal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;I don't mind being romantic, I'll get down on my knees, if
you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Don't don't, the floor's dirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Well then, say "yes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;But you've known me scarcely two weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;And loved you the first time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> saw you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;I wish I'd known it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;(<i>Heartily.</i>) So do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;I'm telling you now, isn't that enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;I've no family, no money save a small allowance from my mother's
estate. I'm really a very poor girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Don't worry about that, I've money enough for two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;The little income I get barely keeps me, but I've managed to
live on it for eight years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>Grimly.</i>) You've got your last check from me, mother dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Poor little woman, what a struggle you must have had to keep
up appearances. (<i>Horn blows outside.</i>) Come, there's Thompson. We can
announce our engagement at the dinner.</p>

<p>(<i>The Gentleman helps Selina into her wraps, while Bart and King again
hide behind counter. Miss Brown enters. She is in a fine rage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;The way law's handed out in this town's a crime, a howlin'
crime!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;What's eatin' ye now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;Lieut. Mason let them murderers off. He's a fool, that's
what he is, a soft pie-eyed fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Aw, forget it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;Don't tell me to forget it, or I'll slap your face for ye,
ye rat.</p>

<p>(<i>Chases Boy behind counter, and bumps into King.</i>) Holy cats!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;(<i>In a whisper of suppressed rage.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> Woman, give me my cane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>Goes to door and shrieks.</i>) Police, police!</p>

<p>(<i>Selina and Gentleman are about to leave, but Selina pulls Gentleman
behind screen again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>To Gentleman.</i>) Come back!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;What's she going to do now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>&mdash;Better leave her be, she's got her dander up.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Officer.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;What do ye want now, Miss Brown?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;Call 'em innocent, if you like, but I got a hunch they're
crooks, and I want you to clear them out of my caf, see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;You got me in wrong once. I ain't huntin' trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>To Gentleman, who urges her forward.</i>) No, no, stay here till
they go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;I came back for my cane, and I'm not going to leave without it.</p>

<p>(<i>Horn blows again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Hang it all, we'll be dreadfully late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>In an ecstasy of fear.</i>) No, no, stay here till they go.
(<i>Leans against screen, which shakes, and almost falls over.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;What's back of that screen? I saw it move!</p>

<p>(<i>Goes toward screen. Bart and King make a bolt for the door, and
Officer stops them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;(<i>Discovering Selina and Gentleman.</i>) Pipe these two dolls,
will ye?</p>

<p>(<i>Selina draws scarf over face, and hurries toward</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> <i>door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;(<i>Detaining her.</i>) Not so fast please, I want to see you first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;We're all right officer, just waiting here out of the cold,
while my car was being&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;(<i>With easy familiarity to Selina.</i>) Hello kid, where did you
hook the gown?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Officer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;Easy, boy, easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Let me pass, you have no right to detain me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;This is an outrage. I'll report you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;(<i>To Selina.</i>) Some style to you now, kid. Who you workin'?
Must have money to rig you out like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Let me pass, I tell you, let me pass!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;You're a wonder, Lena. Your own mother wouldn't know you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;My gosh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;How dare you insult this lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;Say, what are you buttin' in for? Who are you anyway? What's it
matter to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Everything. I'll not let you bulldoze a lady who's going to
be my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;She's not going to be your wife while I'm alive, Clarence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;I don't believe in divorce, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>In suppressed rage.</i>) Keep quiet, will you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;(<i>Coolly.</i>) And she happens to be <i>my</i> wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>(<i>General consternation.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;Good heavens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span>&mdash;Great fish!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;I'll be darned!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Brown</span>&mdash;They're all dotty. The whole fool ranch is dotty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;(<i>Tensely, to Selina.</i>) Is this true, tell me, is this true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;(<i>Shrugging shoulders.</i>) Oh, what's the use!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;Sure, it ain't any use, Lena, but if you're havin' a good time,
go to it. Gawd knows I don't want any more of ye.</p>

<p>(<i>Horn blows again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;I must be going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selina</span>&mdash;Would you mind dropping me at my apartments?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span>&mdash;(<i>Coldly.</i>) Certainly not, if you wish.</p>

<p>(<i>Exeunt Selina and Gentleman. Bart, King and Officer bow to her with
mock courtesy as she passes them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span>&mdash;She's got her nerve, all right. Knew I picked a pippin' when I
married her. She'll cook up some story to hoodwink him before they get
to her apartments. (<i>Stands in doorway, meditatively.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King</span>&mdash;Died in her mother's arms! And I've been keeping the fictitious
old lady eight years.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
